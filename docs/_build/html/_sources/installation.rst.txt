Installation
============

This project relies on Sagemath, for installation instructions
see: `install Sagemath <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/>`_.
The most recent version of this package is developed with Sagemath 9.0, but
more recent versions should also work. 

After installing `sage` run the following command::

    sage -pip install git+https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/bgg-cohomology.git

In MacOS and linux this should run just fine. When using Windows, 
make sure to run this command from the Sagemath Shell.
