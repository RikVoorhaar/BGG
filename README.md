## bgg-cohomology

This is an implementation of a computer algorithm to compute the BGG cohomology of a Lie algebra module. 

## Usage

This module requires `sagemath`, and currently also `numpy-indexed`. 
To install this module, clone or download the repository. Then use `import` statements in sage to 
use the package. 

Examples of usage of this package are in the in the form of Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` directory. Do not hesitate to contact us if more detailed instructions are required. 

## To do

Several important features are currently in development.
- Parallelize the computationally intensive parts of the algorithm
- Add support for a wider class of Lie algebra modules. In particular kernels/cokernels/quotients.

We welcome all feature requests for academic purposes.
